# holocloud - Remote Asset Pipeline

This is the base repository for any remote asset pipeline that can work together with the holocloud.

A remote asset pipeline is a service that can run anywhere and will communicate with the holocloud
via the available APIs.

The tasks of an asset pipeline can range from simple tasks like asset conversion or optimization up
to more complex tasks like asset classification.

Remote asset pipelines can be scaled individually and independently of the holocloud.

For more information on the architecture of the holocloud ecosystem, please refer to the [holocloud's
documentation](https://github.com/Innoactive/HOLOCLOUD-backend) directly.
